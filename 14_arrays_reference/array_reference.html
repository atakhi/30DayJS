    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    let copyPlayers = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    players.splice(0,1);
    console.group('original and =');
    console.log(players);
    console.log(copyPlayers);
    console.groupEnd('original and =');
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    console.group('json stringify');
    copyPlayers = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(players));
    copyPlayers.splice(0,1);
    console.log(copyPlayers);
    console.log(players);
    console.groupEnd('json stringify');
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    let copySlice = players.slice();
    copySlice.splice(0,1);
    console.log(copySlice, players);

    let copyConcat = [].concat(players);

    let copyFrom = Array.from(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    console.group('spread');
    const copySpread = [...players];
    copySpread.splice(0,1);
    console.log(copySpread);
    console.log(players);
    console.groupEnd('spread');
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    let copyPerson = person;
    copyPerson.name = 'aman';
    console.log(person);
    console.log(copyPerson);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    copyPerson = {...person};
    copyPerson.name = 'test';
    console.log(copyPerson);
    console.log(person);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const copyObj = Object.assign({},person,{number:99});
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
